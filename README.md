# MyFlix API

## Description
A REST API for an application called “myFlix” that interacts with a database that stores data about different movies.

This is a he server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

The main purpose of this app is to present how I create a REST API architecture.

This site was built using [Heroku GitHub Deploys](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration).
